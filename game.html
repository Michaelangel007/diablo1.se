				<p>The forces of evil are powerful, but you don't have to face them alone. <em>Diablo</em> will allow up to four players to journey into the labyrinth beneath Tristram as friend or foe. Multi player characters are separate from <a href='game.html#Single Player'>single player</a> characters. A multi player character's state is saved periodically during play, with experience and equipment being carried over from session to session.</p>
