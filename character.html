			<h2 id='Life'>Life</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Life is how much physical harm the character can suffer before dying. The Life total is based on Class, Level, and Vitality. A Warrior, for instance, can take more physical punishment than a Sorcerer of the same Level and Vitality rating. Once Life reaches zero the character is dead. Potions and healing spells can rebuild the human body at an incredible rate, restoring precious Life points.</p>
			</div>

			<h2 id='Mana'>Mana</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Mana is the magical energy that your character possesses, and is used to power spells. It is based on the character's Class, Level, and Magic Attribute. A character that has exhausted his or her Mana is no longer able to cast learned spells. Scrolls and staves may still be used, as they draw their own power from the environment on their own. Special Mana potions are able to restore the hero's spell casting abilities by refreshing the body and clearing the mind of the imbiber.</p>
