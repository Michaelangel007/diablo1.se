# diablo1.se

The aim of [diablo1.se](http://diablo1.se/) is to provide a reference for anything related to the Diablo 1 game engine. This includes file format specifications for all game data files, and instructions on how to losslessly convert these files into modern file formats with open specifications. It also includes an in-depth analysis of the inner workings of the Diablo 1 engine, detailing the dynamic random level generation (DRLG) algorithms, the path finding algorithms, the pseudo-random number generation algorithm, etc.
