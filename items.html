				<p>Over time, weapons and armor wear down until they eventually break. Equipment found in the labyrinth is almost always worn by time and improper care. A gold silhouette of the worn equipment will appear in the corner of the Play Area when it is close to breaking. The silhouette will turn red just before the item is completely destroyed.</p>
				<p>Warriors can perform quick repairs on their equipment, but this inevitably lowers the items' quality over time. A good blacksmith can repair equipment without lowering its long term effectiveness, for a price. Enchanted weapons and armor must be repaired by using the same precious metals and gems that were used during its construction, and can be expensive to have repaired.</p>
